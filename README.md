I wrote this code on google colab that controlls to webcam and asks landing lens for the result.
So you wont have to use any camera app.
You can take pictures for the training data and testing data.

Then I downloaded all of the data by clicking the files tab on the side and downloading them onto landing lens

Then I copied the curl command and a program that uses the landing lens API to make the it predict stuff the same...  but with the webacam!
Here is how you can use it yourself.
for now just press the first 2 cells and type training
and then you can take all the pictures
Then you load them onto landing lens by clicking the file tab on the side!

After that you label the pictures.
Then on the side click model and run live
After you do that
when it asks you for the api key and api secret part type your api key and secret from the landing lens thing
to do that click on deploy and click on the icon on the top right corner
and click api key and press generate and then paste the api keys and api secrets onto your notebook
also paste the link from the curl command and do not use my link or else you are going to authencation error
Then you click the runtime button and click
